Apple Scab,"apply a fungicide, such as Myclotect twice or thrice  in the spring as the leaves emerge."
Apple Black Rot,"check for red cankers and remove them by cutting them out or pruning away the affected limbs at least six inches beyond the wound. Destroy all infected tissue immediately and keep a watchful eye out for new signs of infection

Apple Cedar Apple Rust,"Apply contact fungicide to trees in close proximity to the infected cedar according to the manufacturer’s guidelines. Look for the active ingredient potassium bicarbonate, approved in California for contact fungicide. Spray the trees, including trunk, branches and foliage, when you see yellow spots on the leaves, which often occurs in mid-April"
Apple Healthy,
Blueberry Healthy,
Cherry Healthy,
Cherry Powdery Mildew,"Organic growers must be prepared to spray, and spray often, on a seven-day schedule if disease pressure is moderate to severe"
Corn Cercospora Leaf Spot Gray Leaf Spot,"There are numerous fungicides available for control of Gray leaf spot.  However, there is no guarantee that fungicide applications will result in economic returns, especially if they are applied to highly resistant hybrids in fields with little disease."
Corn Common Rust ,"The most effective method of controlling the disease is to plant resistant hybrids; application of appropriate fungicides may provide some degree on control and reduce disease severity; fungicides are most effective when the amount of secondary inoculum is still low, generally when plants only have a few rust pustules per leaf."
Corn Healthy,
Corn (Maize) Northern Leaf Blight,"Use fungicides effectively, manage residue and select resistant Hybrids."
Grape Black Rot,"use right cultivars, mixture of cultural and chemical control practices"
Grape Esca (Black Measles),Lime sulfur sprays can manage the trio of pathogens that cause black measles
Grape Healthy,
Grape Leaf Blight (Isariopsis Leaf Spot),Fungicides sprayed for other diseases in the season may help to reduce this disease.
Orange Haunglongbing (Citrus Greening),"We can prevent citrus greening by erecting a screen house around known, disease-free citrus trees, but psyllids are small, often no more than 1/8 inch long"
Peach Bacterial Spot,"Spraying with a baking soda solution (a tablespoon of baking soda, 2 1/2 tablespoons of vegetable oil, a teaspoon of liquid soap, not detergent, to one gallon of water), or neem oil (do not use when pollinating insects including bees or other beneficial insects are present)"

Bell Pepper Healthy,
Potato Early Blight,"Fungicides can be used if the disease is severe, but azoxystrobin, chlorothalonil, mancozeb and pyraclostrobin may require multiple applications to destroy the fungus completely. Most of these chemicals must be discontinued two weeks before harvest, but pyraclostrobin can safely be used up to three days before harvest begins."
Potato Healthy,
Potato Late Blight,se potato tubers for seed from disease-free areas to ensure that the pathogen is not carried through seed tuber. Fungicidal sprays on the appearance of initial symptoms. Spraying should be done with Dithane M-45 or Dithane Z-78 (2.5 kg/I 000 litres of water per hectare). Spraying should be repeated at 10-12 days' interval.
Raspberry Healthy,
Soybean Healthy,
Squash Powdery Mildew,"destroy any diseased plant debris, space plantings since a densely planted plot is more likely to be infected, and plant resistant varieties when possible. Also, keep the garden free of weeds. Powdery mildew control may also be need to be combined with a timely application of a fungicide."
Strawberry Healthy,
Strawberry Leaf Scorch,"best way to treat this disease is to alter watering practices and allow for dryer conditions. If that isn't possible, you can treat your strawberries with organic fungicides like Captan 50 WP and Copper compounds. Treat Verticillium wilt by rotating crops."
Tomato Bacterial Spot,"Tomato crop rotation can also be utilized each year to minimize the spread of bacterial spot. In addition, cultivators should ensure that the tomato plants do not receive too much water, as moist conditions attract the spot-causing bacteria."
Tomato Early Blight,Use a copper or sulphur based fungicidal spray to treat the tomato plants. Spray the leaves until they are dripping wet. It is best to use this spray when it is cloudy or first thing in the morning. Avoid using it in full sun when it’s very hot outside. You could inadvertently burn the leaves when any fungicide is applied in full sun.
Tomato Healthy,
Tomato Late Blight,Plant resistant cultivars when available. Also Remove volunteers from the garden prior to planting and space plants far enough apart to allow for plenty of air circulation.
Tomato Leaf Mold,"Remove and destroy all affected plant parts. For plants growing under cover, increase ventilation and, if possible, the space between plants.

Try to avoid wetting the leaves when watering plants, especially when watering in the evening,

Copper-based fungicides can be used to control diseases on tomatoes.

"
Tomato Septoria Leaf Spot,"reating septoria leaf spot disease after it appears is achieved with fungicides. The chemicals need to be applied on a seven- to ten-day schedule to be effective. Spraying begins after blossom drop when the first fruits are visible. The most commonly used chemicals are maneb and chlorothalonil, but there are other options available to the home gardener

Tomato Spider Mites Two-Spotted Spider Mite,"Chemical pesticide use actually encourages the spread of spider mites by killing the beneficial insects that prey on them. Mites are also known to develop quick resistance to various pesticides. For these reasons, it’s important to control mites with effective natural and organic methods"
Tomato Target Spot,"Remove old plant debris at the end of the growing season; otherwise, the spores will travel from debris to newly planted tomatoes in the following growing season, thus beginning the disease anew. Dispose of the debris properly and don’t place it on your compost pile unless you’re sure your compost gets hot enough to kill the spores"
Tomato Mosaic Virus,"Avoid planting in a field where infected tomato plants were grown. Gardening tools, pots, and planters need to be sterilized and washed regularly. A milk solution of 5 gallons of milk to 100 gallons of water or soap and water may be used"
Tomato Yellow Leaf Curl Virus,"Use a neonicotinoid insecticide, such as dinotefuran (Venom) imidacloprid (AdmirePro, Alias, Nuprid, Widow, and others) or thiamethoxam (Platinum), as a soil application or through the drip irrigation system at transplanting of tomatoes or peppers. After the efficacy of the neonicotinoid insecticide application begins to decline, the secondary spread of whiteflies will need to be controlled. Monitor whitefly populations throughout the season, treating when present. Rotate insecticide classes for insecticide resistance management (IRM)"
